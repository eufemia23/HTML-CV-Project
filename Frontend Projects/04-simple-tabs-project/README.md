# Simple Tabs
<a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/simple-tabs">Link to the Project</a>

## Overview 
The task was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create tabs that would display different contents upon clicking. The task tests one's knowledge of DOM manipulation and event handling. This was my first project done fully by myself using JavaScript. It allowed me to consolidate the previously acquired knowledge of the forEach() method, the data attribute and the dataset property.

## How to run the project
1. Clone or download the files in 04-simple-tabs-project.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
