## Overview 
The task was to create a textarea with a dynamic display of the character count and a character limit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If the limit is reached, the textarea would turn red and prevent the user from inputing any more characters. The project tests one's skills in manipulating input elements with JavaScript, handling user input events, and providing real-time feedback to enhance user experience.

## How to run the project
