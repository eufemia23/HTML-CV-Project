# Task Tracker
<a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker-js">Link to the Project</a>

## Overview 
The task was to create a task tracker with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that lets users add new tasks, mark them as complete, unmark them, and delete them. It was recommended to store the tasks in an array of objects with properties for the name and the status. It was also recommended to create a function that would re-render the tasks upon editing or deleting them. This project tested one's knowledge of array manipulation, event handling, and dynamic DOM updates. This project let me practice CSS and learn how to create good-looking buttons with icons inside, as well as all of the JavaScript aspects mentioned above.

## How to run the project
1. Clone or download the files in 08-task-tracker.
